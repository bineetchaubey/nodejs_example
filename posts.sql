This is done by running the git update-index --assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt command. Once marking a file as such, git will completely ignore any changes on that file; they will not show up when running git status or git diff, nor will they ever be committed.\r\n\r\nTo make git track the file again, simply run git update-index --no-assume-unchanged path/to/file.txt.', 2, '0000-00-00', '0000-00-00'),
